# Azure DevOps CI/CD Instructions

## Pipeline Structure Guidelines

### General Principles
- Use YAML-based pipelines for version control and maintainability
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle using templates
- Implement proper environment isolation
- Use variables and variable groups for configuration
- Implement proper security scanning and testing stages

### Naming Conventions
- Pipeline names should be descriptive and follow pattern: `{project}-{purpose}-{environment}`
- Stage names should clearly indicate their purpose: `Build`, `Test`, `Deploy_Dev`, etc.
- Job names should be prefixed with their purpose: `build_`, `test_`, `deploy_`
- Step names should be clear and action-oriented

### Required Pipeline Components

#### Variables
- Environment-specific variables in variable groups
- Secret values in Azure KeyVault
- Build-specific variables at pipeline level
- System variables used appropriately

#### Triggers
- Main branch builds with proper path filters
- PR validation builds with appropriate triggers
- Scheduled builds when necessary
- Environment-based manual approvals

#### Stages
1. **Build Stage**
   - Source code checkout
   - Dependency restoration
   - Compilation/build steps
   - Unit testing
   - Code coverage
   - Static code analysis
   - Artifact publishing

2. **Test Stage**
   - Integration testing
   - Security scanning
   - Compliance checks
   - Performance testing (when applicable)

3. **Deploy Stage**
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Deployment steps
   - Smoke tests
   - Health checks
   - Rollback procedures

### Security Best Practices
- Use service connections with minimum required permissions
- Implement secret scanning
- Enable security validation
- Use approved Microsoft-hosted agents or secure self-hosted agents
- Implement proper approval gates for production deployments

### Environment Management
- Define clear environment progression
- Implement environment-specific variables
- Use deployment gates for critical environments
- Implement proper rollback mechanisms

### Monitoring and Logging
- Enable pipeline analytics
- Implement proper error logging
- Set up alerts for pipeline failures
- Maintain audit trails for deployments

### Quality Gates
- Required code coverage percentage
- Security scan results
- Performance benchmarks
- Test pass rates
- Code quality metrics

## Template Usage

### YAML Templates
- Use template parameters for reusability
- Implement conditional template inclusion
- Version control your templates
- Document template parameters

### Common Templates
- Build templates per technology
- Deployment templates per target
- Quality check templates
- Security scan templates

## Pipeline Variables

### Variable Groups
- Environment-specific groups
- Shared configuration groups
- Secret management groups

### Variable Precedence
1. Runtime variables
2. Pipeline variables
3. Variable groups
4. Template variables
5. System variables

## Error Handling

### Pipeline Failures
- Implement proper error catching
- Use continue-on-error where appropriate
- Set up failure notifications
- Maintain error logs

### Recovery Procedures
- Document rollback procedures
- Implement automated rollbacks
- Maintain deployment history
- Setup recovery points

## Compliance and Governance

### Audit Requirements
- Pipeline execution logs
- Deployment approvals
- Configuration changes
- Access control modifications

### Policy Enforcement
- Branch policies
- Security policies
- Compliance checks
- Required reviewers

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Tests
- Unit tests in build pipeline
- Integration tests in deployment pipeline
- End-to-end tests post-deployment
- Performance tests in separate pipeline

### Manual Testing
- User acceptance testing
- Compliance verification
- Security assessments
- Performance validation
